# DemoProjectUsingFlags

This is repo you will use to practice making a pull request. 

Also you'll compile a little C program that parses flags passed to it. This is so you get a sense of how `cp -r` and `ls -la` etc.. 
handle the flags you pass. You'll write your own program that parses the flags! Cool!

## What to do
* Fork this repository
* Clone your fork to your debian server
* Add a directory called YourName ( not "YourName" - ArupGupta, JaneSmith, RichardRodriguez, whatever YourName is )
* copy the get_opts.c program into the directory called YourName
* Add a few lines of code so the program handles the `-r` flag
* compile and run the code
* take a screenshot showing that you compiled and ran the code
* use `sftp` to  put your screenshot in the YourName folder on your server
* add, commit and push your changes up to github
* make a pull request
* When I look at the pull requests I want to see a directory called YourName containing the code and the screenshot.

## Note
Note that I already created a sample directory called "JulianAureliano" to give you a sense of how to do the assignment.
In that directory you will see I modded the code to handle the `-n` flag (But for your assignment I asked you to add the `-r` 
flag). And you'll see a screenshot.
