# DemoProjectUsingFlags

This is repo you will use to practice making a pull request. 

Also you'll compile a little C program that parses flags passed to it. This is so you get a sense of how `cp -r` and `ls -la` etc.. 
handle the flags you pass. You'll write your own program that parses the flags! Cool!

## What to do
* Fork this repository
* Clone your fork to your debian server
* Add a directory called YourName
* copy the get_opts.c program into the directory called YourName
* Add a few lines of code so the program handles the -r flag
* compile and run the code
* add, commit and push your changes up to github
* make a pull request
